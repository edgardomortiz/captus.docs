      <description>Welcome to Captus, a toolkit for the assembly of phylogenomic datasets (many samples and loci) from High-Throughput Sequencing (a.k.a. Next Generation Sequencing) data. Captus was initially designed specifically for the assembly of target-enriched (e.g. via hybridization of RNA or DNA probes) sequencing data, but has since been expanded to accomodate other common types of HTS data such as Genome Skimming, Hyb-Seq (Target Enrichment + Genome Skimming), RNA-seq, and Whole Genome Sequencing.</description>

      <description>The easy way (recommended) The easiest way is to install Captus through Bioconda. We recommend creating a separate environment for Captus in miniconda:
conda create -n captus -c bioconda -c conda-forge captus Once Captus is installed in its own environment, let&amp;rsquo;s activate it:
conda activate captus And that is all! Notice that the beginning of your prompt should have changed from(base)$ to (captus)$ as we activate the environment.
Just to verify it is correctly installed try typing captus_assembly --help, if everything went OK you should see the following output in the terminal:</description>

      <title>Parallelization</title>
      <link>https://edgardomortiz.github.io/captus.docs/basics/parallelization/</link>

      <description>(and other common options)  Throughout Captus&amp;rsquo; modules we provide common options that allow you limit the computer&amp;rsquo;s resources available to Captus, change the way of running parallel tasks, and control the amount of text shown during a run:
--ram With this option you can specify the maximum RAM in GB that Captus is allowed to use. For example, if your system has 64 GB of RAM and you want to limit the use to 32.</description>
